exit
fn exit(code: i32) -> ()
Immediately terminates the current process and returns the provided exit code to the parent process. During type checking, exit is treated as returning () (this specification does not include a never type). Nevertheless, control flow does not continue after the call at runtime.

exit may appear only as the final statement of the main function. Using exit anywhere else is a semantic error.

fn main() -> () {
    println("done");
    exit(0);
}
The following is invalid:


fn main() -> () {
    exit(1);
    println("unreachable");  // compile-time error
}
